# rock-paper-scissors
Javascript fundamentals project.

First part of this project will be played from the console.
Knowledge check for JavaScript fundamentals will include: 
- Working with variables;
- Functions;
- JavaScript built in functions and methods;
- JavaScript data types;

Later on it will have a fully working and functional GUI.

============================================================

Building a functional UI.

Second part of this project will be played in the browser.
I will demonstrate skills learned so far in the fundamentals part 1 to part 3 for Javascript.

The game will probably be a variation of rock/paper/scissors. Same rules but different style.
